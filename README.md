## Welcome! 👋

In this JS project, I make proverbs appear and disappear one after the other upon clicking the button. First I put all my messages into an array. Then I make a function in which I make a const "notif" that creates a new DOM div element and then I add stylization to it by adding a class "toast". Then I say that I want innertext of my "notif" const to be a function "getRandomMessage". Then I will append another stylization const "toasts" on the "notif". This is so that the printed proverbs are centered on the screen. After I set the timeout so that the proverb disappears after 3 seconds. Last, I make a function I called earlier "getRandomMessage" which pulls random proverb from an array.
